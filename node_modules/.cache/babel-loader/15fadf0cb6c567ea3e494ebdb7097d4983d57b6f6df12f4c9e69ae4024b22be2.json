I have also worked with databases, including SQL and mongoDB, and have created several useful Python scripts to support project development. While I have primarily worked in software development, I am excited about the opportunity to transition into a product management role. I have a strong desire to leverage my technical expertise and collaborate with cross-functional teams to develop products that align with business goals and delight users.
